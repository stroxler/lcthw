The shell script for installing valgrind by hand did not work, but it
has good commands that are worth learning.

In the exe.c file, there are two major errors on line 7, where we did
not give an int to use, and on line 9 where we use an uninitialized int.

Note what happens if you do `make grind`:
  - the first error on line 7 produces warnings due to the -Wall flag
  - the second error on line 9 also does; moreover valgrid complains quite a
    bit
