Unfortunately Zed's makefile did not work out-of-the box.

It turns out that gnu make has a built-in solution to the problem
of gcc flags being platform-dependent: implicit variables. Implicit
variables like CC and CFLAGS are familiar, but the key to getting
platform-independent linking is to use the two variables, which should
be kept independent: LDFLAGS and LDLIBS. All of your -L type flags,
saying which directories to search for libraries, should be in LDFLAGS.
On the other hand it is very important to put the -l flags that give
actual libraries in LDLIBS, because on some platforms like ubuntu they
are *required* to be in a different position.

My makefile now seems to work, and these example tests pass :)
