Unfortunately, this does not compile and so far I cannot work out why. The
linker does not seem to find apr, in spite of me having added it in
/etc/ld.conf.so.d/libc and having run ldconfig

I also compiled Zed's code off github, and the same problems occurred, so
I'm pretty sure it is a system administration issue, not a problem with
my code (which compiles fine, it just doesn't link) or my makefile

I played around a bit, and found that this command produces a working a.out:
cc -g -Wall -I/usr/local/apr/include/apr-1  -I/usr/local/apr/include/apr-util-1  -L/usr/local/apr/lib  -o devpkg devpkg.c bstrlib.o db.o shell.o commands.o -lapr-1 -laprutil-1

What's different here from what make is doing? Make puts all of the link
flags together, and they come before the source files. For some reason, at
least on this Ubuntu distro, gcc seems to want the -l options to come *after*
the file list.

It seems a bit absurd that the make default ordering would not work, but
such is life I guess. As a result, to compile this, just run the command
above by hand. :/

It's possible to fix up the makefile to work for this, but you need to use
more variables and more advanced makefile features, which I'm not going to
do yet because it's covered later in LCTHW.
