ex32 adds some code in list.h and list.c for the lcthw library.

I ran into some build issues getting the tests to statically link to the
library. Firstly, the makefile didn't have the appropriate -L and -l flags
for this.

Secondly, it appears that at least in ubuntu, default linking is dynamic.
I had to add -static to the CFLAGS in order to get the test code to statically
link to liblcthw.a instead of trying to dynamically link with liblcthw.so
(which fails because I would need it to be added to my link directory, either
via an environment variable or via system config).
