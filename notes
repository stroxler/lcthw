ex17: introduction to structures and file i/o. A simple database command-line
      program where each execution is one operation. The database is an exact
      on-disk copy of a simple in-membory database.
       lib: files: fopen, fread, rewind, fwrite, fflush, fclose
              mem: malloc, free, 
              err: errno, perror, exit
            
ex18: bubble sort using function pointers. A good intro to the syntax, not
      much else.
       lib: atoi

ex19: interesting introduction to a prototype-based object system which,
      although too limited to be useful, illustrates
       - some of how C structs work under the hood [tcp/ip uses similar ideas]
       - C's casting rules and the way that void is used as a sort of
         generic (I believe the code here is very illegal in C++)
       - one mechanism of doing prototype-based oop in C... although I think
         this is a bit clunky even for the toy problem and wouldn't work in
         practice.
       - multi-file modules, and use of the C preprocessor
       - a simple architecture for making a game. Note that the Map basically
         drives everything.
      lib: rand, srand, getchar, calloc

ex20: Zed's debug macros. They are good, use this for reference.

ex21 is just a list of operators, types, etc.

ex22: scope rules:
        block scope, static vars in functions, extern global vars (and the
        extern keyword), non-extern vars where the module provides getters and
        setters

ex23: Duff's device. It's kind of interesting, but not important; you can skip.
      lib: memset

ex24: Getting user input (using functions that can also get file input)
       -getting string and numerical input
       -displaying a menu and getting categorial input with enums
      lib: fgets, fscanf

ex25: Basically it's a redo of ex24, except for the enum part, using a custom
      simplified version of scanf. It's a demo of multi-variable arguments.
        lib:  va_list (type), va_start, va_arg
              fgetc, fgets, calloc, check_mem
