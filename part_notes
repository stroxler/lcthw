Part 1 is very small and simple examples, with minimal use of libraries,
giving basic C syntax. It includes everything up to ex16, and covers everything
up to pointers and structs.

Part 2 covers a lot of basic libary usage, and some more advanced syntax
and semantics. It includes dynamic memory, file I/O, varargs, function
pointers. It also includes some of the interesting semantics of C that differ
from languages with more abstraction: flexible casting, relying on byte
orderings when casting between types that take different amounts of space,
writing bytes directly to disk to make binary files. It also introduces
Zed's debug macros.
   (The most important exercises here are probably 17 and 19. 19 is the
    biggest, and the only multi-file example.)
