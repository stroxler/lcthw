Part 1 : ex1 thru ex 15
very small and simple examples, with minimal use of libraries,
giving basic C syntax. It includes everything up to ex16, and covers everything
up to pointers and structs.

Part 2 : ex17 thru ex 25
covers a lot of basic libary usage, and some more advanced syntax
and semantics. It includes dynamic memory, file I/O, varargs, function
pointers. It also includes some of the interesting semantics of C that differ
from languages with more abstraction: flexible casting, relying on byte
orderings when casting between types that take different amounts of space,
writing bytes directly to disk to make binary files. It also introduces
Zed's debug macros.
   (The most important exercises here are probably 17 and 19. 19 is the
    biggest, and the only multi-file example.)

Part 3 : ex26 thru ex31
Starts off with ex26, which is by far the biggest project in the first part
of the book and introduces using third-party libraries, making varous system
calls (via apr, not natively), and compiling/linking nontrivial programs.
 -> The remaining exercises cover some advanced C features like dynamic
    loading, and an intermediate introduction to the core development toolset:
    'real' makefiles, unit testing, debugging.
 -> Since ex26 is a major turning point in the book, I pulled out a copy of
    it into its own directory. The other 'major' project in this section is
    ex31, which uses the full makefile to demo a simple test script.
