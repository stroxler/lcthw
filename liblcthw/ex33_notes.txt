My first attempt at swap in bubble sort was to actually swap nodes, and even
after a solid 40 minutes or so of debugging I couldn't get it to work.

Be aware of a conceptual flaw in the merge sort: it returns a new list given
a list of two or more entries, but with size 0 and 1 lists it returns a
reference to the original list. This is efficient and 'works', but makes
keeping track of references hard. You are likely to either leak memory if you
don't aggressively clean up, or to get double free errors if you do.

The solution is to always check whether the answer is equal to the original,
in the context of the current code. But a better solution would be to force
a copy in the top-level call.

I added a List_print which eventually ought to be touched up and added to
list.h
